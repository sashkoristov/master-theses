| Description |  This master thesis designs an abstract function choreography language (AFCL) and JAVA API (AFCLCore) to build serverless workflow applications or function choreographies (FCs) at a high-level of abstraction. AFCLCore will be integrated in several tools that resulted by bachelor theses. Such AFCLCore-based tools will be integrated into the AFCL environment, which will be able to develop and run portable function choreographies (FCs) across multiple serverless cloud platforms by overcoming individual FaaS provider limits.
|Tasks| 1. Contribute to development of Dependency-Aware Faasifier (DAF) and evaluate it with the state-of-the-art FaaSifiers. <br> 2. Define a Java Interface jFaaS to facilitate portable serverless application development.<br> 3. Describe FCs at a high-level of abstraction in AFCL and create a Java application programming interface to easily build, parse, write and validate FCs.<br> 4. Integrate AFCLCore in the multi-FaaS enactment engine.<br> 5.  Define a model within the AFCL runtime system for distributing parallel loops of an FC across multiple FaaS cloud providers using jFaaS and AFCLCore.<br> 6. AFCL Environment: Integrate AFCLCore-based FCEditor, Scheuler and enactment engine.|
