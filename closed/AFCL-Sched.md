| Description | The aim of this master thesis was to conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the properties and constraints of widely-known FaaS systems (e.g. AWS Lambda, IBM Cloud Functions, Google Cloud Functions, Alibaba Function Compute, etc.). Based on the findings, a multi-objective scheduler was developed for optimal execution of FCs across multiple FaaS systems.| |
