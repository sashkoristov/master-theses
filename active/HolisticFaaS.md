| Title | ***HolisticFaaS*: A web-based platform for management of serverless applications in Federated FaaS** |

| Student | Stefan Achmüller | 
| Status | Requirements analysis | 
| Description |  Each FaaS provider offers a management console where their customers can view and manage serverless functions. Unfortunately, users need to use multiple management consoles when their serverless applications are deployed across different FaaS providers, e.g., due to better performance, lower cost, increased resilience, better service offer, etc. In this master thesis, the student will develop a web-based platform for holistic view of all user serverless applications across different providers. Moreover, the platform will offer migration / replication of applications from one to another user, from one to another cloud region, one to another provider, etc. The system has a holistic view of all source codes (e.g., github), deployment packages, inputs to the applications (e.g., input.json), yaml file of the applications (e.g., AFCL yaml file), etc. <br> *Use case 1*: students do some project and have functions on their own accounts / providers / cloud regions. The lecturer has a hard time to replicate the environment. <br> *Use case 2* The research team comprises multiple users, each with different accounts and need to share / run / replicate serverless applications in federated FaaS.|
|Tasks| 1. Develop a module for migration / replication per user / region / workflow application / function / provider. <br> 2. Develop web-based application for user and serverless application management. <br> 3. Integrate automatic deployer for various FaaS providers (e.g. TerraForm, Serverless Framework, GoDeploy, TestOps).<br> 4. Evaluate migration / replication of serverless applications.|
