| Description | The aim of this master thesis is create a data-aware scheduler that aims to minimize the overall makespan of a serverless workflow in federated FaaS. *AccessLess* analyzes ephemeral data transfers between functions of the workflow and considers network locality. Unlike the related work, which schedules functions only, *AccessLess* schedules where ephemeral data should be stored in federated FaaS.|
| Tasks | 1. Develop a data transfer time model for ephemeral data transfer through storages in federated FaaS. <br> 2. Research techniques for unified storage access from serverless functions.<br> 3. Dynamic setup of bucket URLs in AFCL serverless workflows.<br> 4. Develop the data-aware scheduler *AccessLess* to schedule both functions and ephemeral data location in federated FaaS. <br> 5. Evaluate data transfer time model for ephemeral data transfer between various cloud regions. <br> 6. Evaluate *AccessLess* with real life serverless workflows.||
