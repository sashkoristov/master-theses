| Description | Often, serverless functions are seen as a black-box atomic units that receive data input to compute something and return data output. Many existing works use fusion to merge computation within serverless workflows, thereby reducing invocation latency and ephemeral data transfer between workflow functions. In this thesis, we will dive into the function code and examine to what extent fission of user or serverless functions into multiple smaller chunk-functions would bring benefit in terms of cost and performance. We will also investigate to what extent splitting monoliths can be automatized in order to FaaSify them. Finally, this thesis will explore existing scheduling approaches and their applicability in decision making where each chunk-function should be deployed. ||
