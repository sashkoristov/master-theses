| Description | All cloud providers offer SDKs to easily code applications with their services. While on the one hand, these SDKs simplify developers' effort, they lock users to use other cloud services from the same cloud provider. Such codes (e.g., serverless functions), are neither *portable* (to migrate them on another cloud provider), nor *interoperable* (switch cloud service from another cloud provider). This vendor lock-in prevents users to switch the same service from other providers or to mix services from arbitrary providers. For instance, one cloud provider may reduce storage price, while another cloud provider may introduce more accurate OCR service for preferred language. To bridge this gap, this master thesis introduces CORE (Core Once Run Everywhere), an abstraction library that allows developers to code portable functions that can use interoperable cloud services within serverless workflows (text2speech and OCR). Moreover, heuristics will be researched to select the appropriate service based on user objectives.|
| Tasks | 1. Research techniques for unified service access from serverless functions for AWS's and Google's text2speech and OCR services. <br> 2. Develop a service time model for text2speech and OCR in federated FaaS. <br> 3. Dynamic setup of service input data in AFCL serverless workflows.<br> 4. Develop the abstraction library *CORE* to code portable functions with interoperable cloud services text2speech and OCR. <br> 5. Evaluate the service time model for text2speech and OCR for various cloud regions and input data location. <br> 6. Evaluate *CORE*'s benefits with real life serverless workflows.||
