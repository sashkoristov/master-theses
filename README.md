# Active master theses



## *LLM-Energy*

| Title | **LLM-Energy*: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Energy Advisory Conversations** |
| ----- | ----- | 
| Student | Simon Brandacher | 
| Status | Finalizing | 
| Description | This master thesis proposes the development of a fine-tuned language model specialized in renewable energy advisory (i.e., answering consumers’ questions related to renewable energy). The work includes the creation of a domain-specific Q&A dataset, the fine-tuning of open-source LLMs (i.e., Mistral NeMo 12B, DeepSeek-R1 8B, Llama 3.2 3B) using this data, and a comparative performance evaluation against general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, LLaMA, and DeepSeek-R1. The evaluation will comprise both automatic metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BERTScore) and expert assessments to ensure meaningful comparisons in accuracy and helpfulness.|

## *FloatingOrca*



| Title | **FloatingOrca*: A Polyglot Serverless Workflow Management System Facilitating Cross-Cloud Development and Dynamic Flows** |
| ----- | ----- | 
| Student | Thomas Oberroither | 
| Status | Finalizing | 
| Description |  This master's thesis explores the development of a workflow management system within the domain of serverless computing, specifically Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). The system is designed to support workflows that span multiple programming languages and cloud providers, enhancing flexibility and reducing vendor lock-in. A key focus is on dynamic control and data flow. Unlike traditional solutions that rely on global workflow definitions, this system proposes a new approach that grants greater control to individual functions within the workflow. To achieve this, it integrates communication mechanisms for coordination between functions. By streamlining both development and deployment—while avoiding restrictive and complex domain-specific languages—the system also aims to lower the barrier to adopting serverless workflows.
